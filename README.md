## About BloodHorn
BloodHorn is a modern, high-performance bootloader built on the EDK2 framework with Coreboot integration. Designed for speed, security, and reliability, it provides a robust foundation for system initialization across multiple architectures.

## Important Safety Notice

BloodHorn is a low-level system component that interacts directly with hardware. Incorrect use may result in system damage, data loss, or security vulnerabilities.

### Intended Audience
- System firmware developers
- Security researchers
- Embedded systems engineers
- Advanced users with recovery capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- UEFI/BIOS and system architecture knowledge
- Low-level programming experience (C, assembly) or at least knowing fundumentals of dealing with low level components
- Secure boot and firmware security understanding
- Hardware recovery tools and procedures

### System Impact
BloodHorn operates at the hardware level with the following characteristics:
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64, ARM, RISC-V, LoongArch)
- EDK2 Framework Integration
- Coreboot Payload Support
- Security features including TPM and secure boot
- Modular plugin architecture

Note: The BloodHorn team is not responsible for any hardware damage or data loss resulting from the use of this software.

## Project History

### Origins (2016)
The BloodHorn project originated from an open-source bootloader prototype discovered in 2016. The initial codebase was developed by an anonymous contributor and shared on a technical forum in 4chan. The current maintainer recognized its potential and began maintaining and expanding the project.

### Development Timeline
- **2016-2018**: Core functionality refinement and initial testing
- **2019-2021**: Major architectural improvements and feature additions
- **2022-2023**: Codebase modernization and security enhancements
- **2024-Present**: Active maintenance and community development

### Project Philosophy
BloodHorn is developed with a focus on:
- Technical excellence
- Minimal resource usage
- Clean, maintainable code
- Practical functionality over marketing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Python 3.7 or later
- C/C++ toolchain (GCC/Clang on Linux/macOS, MSVC on Windows)
- EDK2 (pre-installed and configured)

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Git
- Python 3.7 or later
- C/C++ toolchain (GCC/Clang on Linux/macOS, MSVC on Windows)
- EDK2 BaseTools (included in Edk2BHModules)
- NASM (for assembly components)
- iASL (for ACPI support)

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
git clone --recursive https://codeberg.org/PacHashs/BloodHorn.git
cd BloodHorn
# Build BaseTools if not already built
make -C Edk2BHModules/BaseTools
# Set up build environment
source edksetup.sh
# Build BloodHorn (Release)
build -p BloodHorn.dsc -b RELEASE -t GCC5 -a X64 -n $(nproc)
# Or for Debug build with Coreboot support
# build -p BloodHorn.dsc -b DEBUG -t GCC5 -a X64 -n $(nproc) -D COREBOOT_ENABLED=1
```

#### Windows
```cmd
git clone --recursive https://codeberg.org/PacHashs/BloodHorn.git
cd BloodHorn
:: Build BaseTools if not already built
cd Edk2BHModules\BaseTools
nmake
cd ..\..
:: Set up environment (run from Visual Studio x64 Native Tools Command Prompt)
:: Build BloodHorn (Release)
build -p BloodHorn.dsc -b RELEASE -t VS2019 -a X64
:: Or for Debug build with Coreboot support
:: build -p BloodHorn.dsc -b DEBUG -t VS2019 -a X64 -D COREBOOT_ENABLED=1
```

Output files:
- `Build/BloodHorn/RELEASE_<TOOLCHAIN>/X64/BloodHorn.efi`
- `Build/BloodHorn/DEBUG_<TOOLCHAIN>/X64/BloodHorn.efi`

## Installation

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Mount EFI partition (if not already mounted)
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/efi

# Install BloodHorn
cp Build/BloodHorn/RELEASE_GCC5/X64/BloodHorn.efi /mnt/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
```

### Windows (Admin)
```cmd
:: Install to default boot location
copy Build\BloodHorn\RELEASE_VS2019\X64\BloodHorn.efi C:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
```

> **Note:** Always back up your existing bootloader before installation.

## Features

- **Architectures**: x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V, LoongArch
- **Security**: Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, file verification
- **Firmware**: Coreboot + UEFI hybrid
- **Configuration**: INI/JSON/UEFI variables
- **UI**: Text and graphical interfaces with localization
- **Performance**: Optimized boot times
   ```

4. **Basic Configuration**:
   Create a minimal `bloodhorn.ini` at your EFI partition root:
   ```ini
   [boot]
   default = linux
   menu_timeout = 5
   language = en
   font_path = /fonts/ter-16n.psf

   [linux]
   kernel = /boot/vmlinuz
   initrd = /boot/initrd.img
   cmdline = root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet
- **Recovery Mode**: For when you thought "rm -rf /" was a good idea at 3 AM
- **Boot Speed**: Faster than you can say "I'll just check Reddit while I wait"

## Coreboot Integration

BloodHorn features comprehensive Coreboot firmware integration through the CorebootPayloadPkg. When built with Coreboot support, it provides:

- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects when running as a Coreboot payload
- **Hybrid Initialization**: Leverages Coreboot's hardware initialization while maintaining UEFI compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of Coreboot memory maps and tables
- **Hardware Access**: Direct access to Coreboot-provided hardware information
- **Performance**: Optimized boot path when running on Coreboot

### Building with Coreboot Support

To enable Coreboot payload support, use the `COREBOOT_ENABLED` flag during build:

```bash
build -p BloodHorn.dsc -b RELEASE -t GCC5 -a X64 -D COREBOOT_ENABLED=1
```

### CorebootPayloadPkg

The CorebootPayloadPkg provides the following features:
- Coreboot table parsing and validation
- Memory map translation between Coreboot and UEFI formats
- Hardware information extraction from Coreboot tables
- Integration with the main BloodHorn bootloader

For more details, see the [CorebootPayloadPkg documentation](Edk2BHModules/CorebootPayloadPkg/README.rst).
